# HTML Drills
These tasks are designed to familiarize yourself with HTML 5 elements and their default behavior.

## HTML Drills
1. Use the Emmet abbreviation in VS Code to create an `index.html` page, and then open that file in your browser.
2. Inside the `<body>` of your page, use all six heading elements with a paragraph element after each one. The text used in the heading and paragraphs are up to you.
3. Add a comment before each heading to give yourself a reminder what the purpose of that section should be.
4. Add an image after each paragraph in your page.
5. "Wrap" each section (heading, paragraph, and image) with a `<section>` tag. The open section tag should precede the first heading tag, and the closing section tag should be after the image tag. *Remember to indent properly!* (Tip: if your indentation ever gets out of whack, just right click anywhere in VS Code and click "Format Document"!)
6. In between every paragraph and image, create an unordered list with at least three list items. Again, the content contained in this list is up to you!
7. Create a form with three inputs: first name, last name, and email address. Make sure each input is labeled, and that all of them are wrapped with form tags.
8. Add a button to the form using an input tag.
9. Wrap the entire page in a `<div>`.
10. Reformat the document. How does it change compared to what you had originally written?
11. Add a horizontal line between each section in your document.
12. Add hyperlinks to each image that opens the image in a new tab.
13. At the top of your page, create a table with the following columns (headers): Month, Day, Year.
14. Then, add a row for each day that you worked on these tasks.
15. In the last heading element (h6) add either a copyright or trademark HTML symbol entity to the end of the text content.
