# CSS Drills
These tasks are designed to familiarize yourself with CSS3 styles and their default behavior.

They should only be completed **after** the HTML 5 drills that were assigned in the previous section.

## CSS Tasks
1. Create a new CSS file, and link it to your `index.html` file.
2. Define three new rulesets: one for `*`, one for `body`, and one for `@media (max-width: 700px)`. Inside of the `@media` ruleset, duplicate the `*` and `body` rulesets.
3. For `*`, change the font-family to `Helvetica` and define the font-size as `1em`. For `body`, remove all margin and padding. For the duplicates inside of `@media`, make the font-size `1.2em` and the padding (on all sides) as `1em`.
4. Give each image in your HTML the same class. Define that class and set the height to `300px`. Also, give each picture a border-radius and drop-shadow. Tinker with those two properties until you are satisfied with the appearance.
5. Next, create a pseudo-class for your image class you created in Step 4. When you hover over the image, it should increase its height by 10% and the drop-shadow should also become more pronounced.
6. Center the images horizontally across the page.
7. With only one ruleset, apply the same color to _all_ of your headings, and adjust the margin-top property for these headings to 1.5em.
8. Give each `<section>` a class, and in the ruleset for that class define a light gray background-color, border, border-radius, and border-color. Also, give each section a padding of `1em`.
9. Float the third and fourth headers left and right, respectively. Appropriately use the `clear` property so that your content does not overlap.
10. Use the font-style property to italicize every unordered list. Now, make the second list item in every unordered list bold and a unique color.
11. Give the outermost "wrapping" `div` a class "container". Give it a width of 90%, and a margin of `0 auto`.
12. Make the contact form input fields take up the 50% of the container. Adjust the margin of the form to `0 auto`.
13. Remove the default underline on all hyperlinks. Change their  color to either red, blue, or green.
